# Product-Price-Prediction

This data science project aims to predict the sale price of used cars in India by analyzing a dataset of used car listings. 

The project aims to provide statistical information on the average sale price and the used car market in India, in order to help people make informed buying choices and get a good deal on a used vehicle.

The questions that the project will tackle include:

* What is the average price for a car
* What is the average kms driven for a car
* What are the top car features that influence price
* The machine learning objective of this project is to minimize the difference between the real price and the price estimated by the model.

The model performance will be evaluated using three metrics:

* Mean squared error (MSE)
* Root squared of the mean squared error (RMSE)
* R-squared (R2)

The project will use supervised machine learning techniques and will use the provided dataset to train and test the model. 

The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the sale price of used cars in India, based on various factors such as car features, kms driven and others.

The final model will be deployed to a web app or API for end-users to use.
